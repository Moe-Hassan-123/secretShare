							<span key={2}>
								<strong>Sharing:</strong> You receive a secure link containing the secret's ID and the decryption key.

							<span key={3}>
								<strong>Viewing:</strong> When the recipient opens the link, the encrypted secret is retrieved and decrypted in their browser.

								<strong>Deletion:</strong> After viewing, the encrypted secret is immediately and permanently deleted from our servers.
